## 🧠 About Me

I'm an undergraduate student passionate about the intersection of **artificial intelligence, programming, and human creativity**.  
I study **Artificial Intelligence at Yonsei University**, where I explore how technology can reason, learn, and express - just like people do 🤖💭.

I love transforming complex ideas into elegant code - whether it’s an AI-driven system, an interactive simulation, or a playful experiment in logic.  
For me, programming is both **a language of precision and imagination**, bridging the gap between *how we think* and *how machines learn*.

## 🌍 Multilingual & Global

🗣️ I’m fluent in **Korean**, **English**, and **French** — three languages that help me connect across cultures and think in different patterns.  
I believe that language, like code, shapes the way we perceive and express intelligence.

## 🌟 Philosophy

> “Intelligence isn’t just about solving problems - it’s about creating meaning.”

I aim to make technology feel *alive and thoughtful*, not just functional.  
Every project I take on is a small step toward building systems that **learn, adapt, and inspire curiosity**.

## 🧩 Beyond Code

When I’m not programming, you’ll find me experimenting with  
🎮 **indie game design concepts**,  
📚 **researching human-AI collaboration**, or  
🎧 **mixing electronic music** for fun.  

I like to think of creativity as a form of computation, just with a human twist.
