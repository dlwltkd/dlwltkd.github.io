## 🧠 About Me

I'm a student at **Yonsei University**, exploring how **artificial intelligence and human creativity** intersect.  
My work and studies focus on **programming, intelligent systems, and problem-solving through code** — always driven by curiosity and a bit of imagination ✨.

I enjoy turning abstract ideas into something real, whether that’s a working prototype, an interactive game, or a data-driven insight.  
To me, programming is more than syntax — it’s a creative tool for understanding how people and machines can think together 🤖💭.

## 🚀 Current Focus

- 🤖 **AI & Machine Learning** — experimenting with models that simulate reasoning and memory  
- 🧩 **Game Development** — building interactive systems using **Python** and **C++ (SFML)**  
- 💬 **Conversational Systems** — designing NPC dialogue and generative storytelling  
- 📊 **Research Exploration** — studying algorithms, logic, and human-computer interaction

## 💻 Skills & Tools

**Languages:** Python 🐍, C++ ⚙️  
**Frameworks & Libraries:** SFML, OpenAI API, Tkinter, NumPy  
**Other Interests:** Data visualization, creative coding, automation

## 🌟 Philosophy

> “Intelligence isn’t just about solving problems — it’s about creating meaning.”

I aim to make technology feel *alive and thoughtful*, not just functional.  
Every project I take on is a small step toward building systems that **learn, adapt, and inspire curiosity**.

## 🧩 Outside of Code

When I’m not programming, you’ll find me experimenting with  
🎮 **indie game design concepts**,  
📚 **researching human-AI collaboration**, or  
🎧 **mixing electronic music** for fun.  

I like to think of creativity as a form of computation — just with a human twist 😎.
